abstract: In free societies, the duration of COVID-19, in theory, will depend on how compliant people are, andfor how long. It is a safe assumption to say that the more authoritative regimes are going to have moresuccess at social distancing. Thus, this has appeared to be successful in China, if their numbers areaccurate. Western countries are less adept at having a restriction on their civil liberties, even in a time ofpandemic crisis. No government other than the most repressive will believe it can keep its country onlock down for months on endâ€”and even if it could, the economic effects would be intolerable.
